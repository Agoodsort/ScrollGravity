# Balance Theory: Scroll Gravity

## Theory of Entropy-Curvature Coupling in Galactic Dynamics

**Pre-registered Analysis Plan | Zenodo DOI: [Will appear after release]**

This repository contains the pre-registered analysis plan for testing the Balance Theory of scroll gravity - a novel framework that explains galactic rotation curves and cosmic web alignments through entropy-curvature coupling.

## 📋 Pre-registration Status
- **Registered:** [Date of first Zenodo release]
- **Hypotheses:** 8 falsifiable tests (H1-H8)
- **Data Sources:** SPARC rotation curves, MaNGA kinematics, SDSS cosmic filaments
- **Methods:** Bayesian model comparison, alignment statistics, lensing predictions

## 🎯 Key Predictions
1. **H1:** Rotation curve downturn beyond 2λ_c
2. **H2:** Bayesian evidence superiority over NFW/Burkert halos
3. **H3:** Environmental scaling (λ_c vs filament proximity)
4. **H4:** Layered spin-filament alignment (gas vs stars)
5. **H5-H6:** Lensing consistency and anisotropy
6. **H7:** Satellite dynamics alignment
7. **H8:** Void boundary effects
